# Bacillus Subtilis artificial dataset creator

This project allows the creation of an artificial fluorescent bacteria dataset oriented for bacteria counting.

## Description

By using template backgrounds, which are microscopic images from a blank agar plate, the program will alter pixel values
defined by two Gaussian ellipses with different, random distributions, rotations, and XY positions in the image.

After
running the main script, generated images will be saved in the specified folders and a csv with the name, number of
instances and centroid locations wil be created.

NOTE: the generated images will have a resolution of 3280x2464 pixels.

## Getting Started

### Executing scripts

There are only two hyperparameters to consider, that are defined in the "main.py" file:

* N: Total number of images desired to generate for the dataset
* max_cells: Maximum number of cells that the script will add in the images

Running the main.py script will create 'N' images using the different backgrounds in the DATASET/Background folder. The
images will have from 0 to 'max_cells' number of bacteria.
